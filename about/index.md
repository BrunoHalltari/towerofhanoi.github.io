We are the Tower of Hanoi (also known as Hanoiati), the Politecnico di Milano CTF team.
We are a group of B.Sc, M.Sc, and Ph.D. students interested in information security, who love to play CTF and sometimes to organize them too (check out the [PoliCTF](http://polictf.it)!).
Our [CTFTime profile](https://ctftime.org/team/300) lists the competitions we recently took part to.

We usually meet weekly in the [NECSTLab](http://necst.it), the Politecnico di Milano computer security and computer architecture laboratory.
During our meetings, we discuss and review together the past CTF challenges and other interesting information security topics.

## What is a CTF?

CTFs are information security competitions, aimed at teaching how to find, exploit and patch security vulnerabilities and, in turn, how to avoid vulnerabilities when writing software.

Some CTFs (Capture the Flag) are organized as *attack-defense* competitions:
different teams receive a virtual machine image with some vulnerable (network) services;
each team has to find the vulnerabilities, patch them in its own image to defend themselves from the attacks of other teams, and exploit the vulnerabilities attacking other teams to gain tokens (i.e., flags) needed to score game points.

In the *jeopardy-style* CTFs, teams are presented with a set of specific challenges in a range of categories, touching aspects such as vulnerability exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography and others.
